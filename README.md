## Why i made this app:

this app was built for a local initiative for people who work together in a shared garden.

Via this app, they get an overview of what crops are planted on which location.

The users can add vegetables or tasks themself after they created a login.

Front-end was built with react and redux and deployed to netlify, [back end](https://github.com/bjille/samentuin-backend) was built with node.js and deployed to heroku. data is stored in mongodb atlas.
